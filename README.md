Hotel Management System


This is a simple Hotel management application which offers basic functions like customer registration, room booking, e-billing, etc.
This project was completely built on python using tkinter for the GUI purpose.
MySQL was user to store the database. The database consists of a table named CostInfo which all the information of a customer.
I have also implemented CSV files in this project which stores the info about the room descriptions and the menu card.
After you clone this repo to your local computer, you will have to download and set up MySQL database in your machine. Create a database with name of your choice, and create a table with name ConstInfo.
Update your password, root and the database name to the HM.py file.
And you are all set to run this code on your local machine !!!.
