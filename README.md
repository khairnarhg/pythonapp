Hotel Management System


This is a simple Hotel management application which offers basic functions like customer registration, room booking, e-billing, etc.
This project was completely built on python using tkinter for the GUI purpose.
MySQL was user to store the database. The database consists of a table named CostInfo which all the information of a customer.
I have also implemented CSV files in this project which stores the info about the room descriptions and the menu card.
